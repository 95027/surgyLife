                <h2>#HealthyAtHome</h2>
                <p>he COVID-19 pandemic means that many of us are staying at home and doing less in terms of social interactions and exercise. This can have a negative effect on your physical and mental health. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below is advice to help you and your family to stay healthy at home during this period of confinement.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Staying physically active</li>
                    <p>
                        The COVID-19 pandemic means that many of us are staying at home  and sitting down more than we usually do. It’s hard for a lot of us to do the sort of exercise we normally do. It’s even harder for people who don’t usually do a lot of physical exercise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But at a time like this, it’s very important for people of all ages and abilities to be as active as possible. WHO’s Be Active campaign aims to help you do just that - and to have some fun at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Remember - Just taking a short break from sitting, by doing 3-4 minutes of light intensity physical movement, such as walking or stretching, will help ease your muscles and improve blood circulation and muscle activity.
                    </p>
                    <li>Looking after our mental health</li>
                    <p>
                        As countries introduce measures to restrict movement as part of efforts to reduce the number of people infected with COVID-19, more and more of us are making huge changes to our daily routines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues take time to get used to. Adapting to lifestyle changes such as these, and managing the fear of contracting the virus and worry about people close to us who are particularly vulnerable, are challenging for all of us. They can be particularly difficult for people with mental health conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fortunately, there are lots of things that we can do to look after our own mental health and to help others who may need some extra support and care.
                    </p>
                    <li>Quitting tobacco</li>
                    <p>
                        Why should you quit smoking and how can you do it?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Smokers have a higher risk of getting coronavirus because they are constantly putting their hands to their lips.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And then, if they get coronavirus, they run a greater risk of getting a severe case because their lung function is impaired. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Quit today to reduce these risks and start living a healthier life.
                    </p>
                    <li>Healthy parenting</li>
                    <p>
                        Across the world, due to the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), children are affected by physical distancing, quarantines and nationwide school closures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some children and young people may be feeling more isolated, anxious, bored and uncertain.They may feel fear, and grief, over the impact of the virus on their families.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Working with our partners, WHO will bring you content to help open the world of isolation. Watch out for resources and ideas to support parents and projects that will engage children in understanding the coronavirus, the challenges it brings to their world and what can be done to protect them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will also introduce children to creative content that will entertain and provide a much-needed escape into the fun and magical worlds of imagination.
                    </p>
                    <li>Eating healthily</li>
                    <p>
                        Eating a healthy diet is very important during the COVID-19 pandemic. What we eat and drink can affect our body’s ability to prevent, fight and recover from infections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While no foods or dietary supplements can prevent or cure COVID-19 infection, healthy diets are important for supporting immune systems. Good nutrition can also reduce the likelihood of developing other health problems, including obesity, heart disease, diabetes and some types of cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For babies, a healthy diet means exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months, with the introduction of nutritious and safe foods to complement breastmilk from age 6 months to 2 years and beyond. For young children, a healthy and balanced diet is essential for growth and development. For older people, it can help to ensure healthier and more active lives.
